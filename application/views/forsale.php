<p><img src="/images/forsale/standing.jpg" width="180" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 0 0;">We have a wide selection of alpacas for sale to suit your lifestyle and budget. Whether you are a novice or experienced owner we can help.</p>
<p>We have all colours from snowy white to luscious black and can arrange a package of your choice.</p>
<p>Young males are ideally suited to the novice owner with a few acres of pasture, where a minimum of two alpacas can be kept. Three males will provide protection for poultry or sheep, keeping the fox at bay!</p>
<p>All Jupiter Alpacas are vaccinated, micro-chipped and registered with the British Alpacas Society.</p>
<p><img src="/images/forsale/group.jpg" width="180" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 0 0;">A minimum of three females can be kept and are usually sold pregnant. They will have been mated by one of the Jupiter Alpaca studs to produce a beautiful healthy baby cria. The gestation period is 11.5 months so you have time to anticipate the baby cria's arrival.</p>
<p>We have a full after sales service which includes helping you set up your farm, how best to manage your Alpacas and set up a herd (if required). </p>
