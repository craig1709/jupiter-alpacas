<p>All our beautifully soft luxury garments and accessories are individually knitted by local craftsmen using 100% pure alpaca fleece produced by our very own Jupiter Alpacas in North Shropshire. All our handcrafted garments and accessories are unique, warm, luxuriously soft yet hardwearing.  </p>
<p>Our garments and accessories naturally follow the seasons and all our colours are completely natural and are shorn from our alpacas each year. No chemicals are used in the production or processing of the fibre and all buttons are hand-made in ceramic. Easily recyclable and very few travelled miles!</p>
<p>We recommend washing garments by hand and drying naturally.</p>
